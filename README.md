# RenPyTerminal

A powerful terminal plugin for RenPy that supports VT100/ANSI escape codes. 

Based upon the `pyte` Python library. It's not included in the code for legal reasons. You need to install it by calling:

```
pip install --target game/python-packages pyte
```

This repo is not just the library itself. It's a demo RenPy game that contains the library itself (most of the files are in `game/terminal`).
