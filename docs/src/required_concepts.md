# Required concepts

This chapter outlines what you should know before heading into this library. It will explain a lot of what's going on and why things where done a certain way. It's also required in order to do basic manipulation of your output like changing the color of the text and moving the cursor.

You are not required to read all of it, this is just a list of things that you should at least understand the concept of.
